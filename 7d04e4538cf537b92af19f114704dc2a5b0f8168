I'm not sure that supporting clouds and accounts not available in the extension config but registering later by a compiler pass is that worth it, especially for the default_cloud for the autowiring part.
We could decide that the autowiring is only provided if the default_cloud is one of the clouds defined in the bundle config (there would be no BC break, as autowiring is new anyway).

@xabbuh should we deprecate cases where accounts referenced by config-defined clouds are not defined in the config, and the case where the default cloud is not one of the config-defined ones ?

Yes, I think we do not need to support these cases.

Do you want to do that as part of this PR?
